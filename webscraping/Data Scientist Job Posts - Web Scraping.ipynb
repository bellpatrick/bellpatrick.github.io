    "Even though several people have taken on similar projects, there has not been a strict focus on; 1) remote jobs, 2) current jobs / a tool I can reuse. I've also not seen a lot of EDA + visualization that was super useful for new data scientists to zero in their training on the most marketable skills (at the time).\n",
